# Drum-Kit
To learn more about Javascript and DOM Manipulation, I created a Drum Kit that takes in keyboard presses and button presses in order to play different drumbeats and sounds. It's a lot of fun to play with, actually, and it took a lot of work to actually make and understand how it works. This was a great project, and I enjoyed doing it!
